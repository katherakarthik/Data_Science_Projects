📊 Data Science Projects (Python)

This repository contains a collection of Data Science projects implemented using Python, based on hands-on practice from the Python for Data Science learning path (freeCodeCamp).
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate core data analysis workflows, clean coding practices, and consistent use of GitHub for project documentation.


📌 Objectives

Practice Python fundamentals for Data Science

Learn structured data analysis workflows

Apply data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques

Build the habit of publishing and documenting code on GitHub

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Version Control: Git, GitHub

✅ Projects Overview

Each project in this repository follows a similar structure:

Loading and inspecting datasets

Cleaning and preprocessing data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Creating visualizations for insights

Drawing basic conclusions based on analysis

The projects are tutorial-guided implementations, created to strengthen understanding of data science fundamentals through practical coding.

📊 Key Skills Demonstrated

Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Data visualization with Matplotlib

Working with real datasets

Writing organized and readable notebooks

Using GitHub for code versioning and sharing

⚠️ Important Note

These projects are learning-focused and tutorial-based.
They are intended to demonstrate hands-on practice and conceptual understanding, not production-grade systems.

🚀 How to Use

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/DataScience-Projects.git


Open notebooks using Jupyter

Run cells sequentially to follow the analysis

📈 Future Improvements

Add independent datasets for deeper analysis

Improve visual storytelling

Convert selected notebooks to end-to-end mini projects
