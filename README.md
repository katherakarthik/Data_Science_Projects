🧠 Data Science Projects — Web Scraping & Data Visualization
📘 Overview

This repository contains two beginner-to-intermediate level data science projects focused on data collection (Web Scraping) and data visualization using Python.
The goal of these projects is to understand how to gather, clean, and visualize data for real-world analysis.

🕸️ Project 1 — Football Data Web Scraping
🔹 Objective

To collect football match data (seasons, scores, teams, etc.) from football-uk.co.uk
 using Python-based web scraping techniques.

🔹 Tools & Libraries

Python

BeautifulSoup

Requests

Pandas

🔹 Steps Performed

Sent HTTP requests to the football-uk.co.uk website and parsed the HTML pages.

Extracted structured data such as season, teams, and match details.

Cleaned and stored the dataset in a CSV file for further analysis.

🔹 Outcome

Created a football dataset with multiple seasons of match data that can be used for future analytics and machine learning tasks.

📊 Project 2 — Population Data Visualization
🔹 Objective

To visualize demographic trends using a population dataset (CSV file) through different types of charts and summary tables.

🔹 Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

🔹 Steps Performed

Loaded the population dataset using Pandas.

Created Pivot Tables to summarize population data across categories.

Generated multiple visualizations:

📈 Line Chart

📊 Bar Plot

🥧 Pie Chart

📦 Box Plot

📉 Histogram

⚪ Scatter Plot

Analyzed patterns and compared population changes visually.

🔹 Outcome

Produced clear, data-driven visual insights from raw population data using Python visualization libraries.

🧰 Skills Demonstrated
